				<h1>// weekly updates</h1>

                <h3>02/12/16 @ 7-9 P.M.</h3>
				This week we discussed our plans for our skybox and began searching the Second Life Marketplace for items to fit our Tim Burton theme in-world. As a group, we found items such as pumpkins, haunted houses, and even an AI dragon! Alexis, Govind, Kairi and Yong spent most of the two hours decorating the skybox while Lisa worked to re-program the AI dragon to respond to new customized phrases and possibly help users if they get stuck while completing our tasks.</p>

				<p>We also went over ideas for our tasks and started to gather ideas for our story. By the assignment due date, we were able to create the three tasks we wanted other users to complete (find the portal to our realm, teleport to our realm, and then find our three horcruxes) and we also started to construct the story behind our alternate world. You may remember Gayle from our original island… well now she’s found herself in the after world and it’s your job to bring her back to life.</p>

				<p>The game we created for our users is simple: it’s a scavenger hunt. Not only do they have to find our skybox, but they have to figure out how to teleport into it. Once that’s completed, each team will have to work together to find the three horcruxes (metal sword, gold necklace, and Tom Riddle’s diary) that we hid throughout the structures in our skybox. If you think this is an easy search… you better think again. Our world is scary and it’s dark, it’s definitely no walk in the park. You’ll have to think outside of the box if your team plans to find each one of our items within the time allotted to you.</p>

				<p>We are still currently modifying our island with more decorations and refining our tasks to make sure there’s nothing unclear in the scavenger hunt we have planned for the rest of our class.</p>
